I have waited for 4 1/2 months for Dragon Stalker helm to drop to finaly complete my 8 piece set of T2. All the hunters in our raid group have been very excited to get the 8 piece buff. Well i did a raid never saw it proc nor did anyone else, so I went and killed some elite world mobs afterward by myself and didn't see or increase of my attack power at anytime. I guess its broken sadly. kind of a big let down.
